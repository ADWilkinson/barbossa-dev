DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES (IN ORDER):
1. NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION - Create valuable new functionality

4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - Improve speed and efficiency
5. ACCESSIBILITY ENHANCEMENTS - Better keyboard nav, screen readers, ARIA
6. MOBILE/RESPONSIVE DESIGN - Optimize for all screen sizes
7. BUG FIXES - Only fix user-facing bugs that impact functionality

STRICTLY AVOID:
- Writing test cases or unit tests (only fix broken existing tests if blocking)
- Creating test files or test suites
- Spending time on test coverage improvements
- Documentation unless it's user-facing (e.g., UI tooltips, help text)

GIT WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
1. ALWAYS pull latest from main branch first: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. ALWAYS create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/description-YYYYMMDD`
3. Make your changes and commits on the feature branch
4. Use descriptive commit messages focusing on the feature/improvement
5. Push the feature branch: `git push origin feature/description-YYYYMMDD`
6. Create a Pull Request to main branch for review using GitHub CLI
7. NEVER commit directly to main branch
8. NEVER push directly to main branch

FEATURE SELECTION STRATEGY:
1. Check each repository for existing issues or enhancement opportunities
2. Identify areas where users would benefit most from improvements
3. Prioritize visible, user-facing changes over internal refactoring
4. Focus on features that can be completed in a single session
5. Consider UI/UX improvements that enhance the overall experience

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Select a repository based on work tally (favor least-worked repos)
2. Clone/pull the repository following security validation
3. Analyze current state and identify feature opportunities
4. Implement NEW FEATURES or UI/UX improvements
5. Ensure code builds and existing functionality isn't broken
6. Create a feature-focused pull request
7. Document the user value in the PR description
8. Log all activities to changelog

DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:
- Prefer modern UI patterns and best practices
- Use existing design systems/component libraries when available
- Ensure responsive design for all new features
- Add proper loading states and error handling
- Include helpful user feedback (toasts, modals, tooltips)
- Optimize for performance and smooth interactions
- Follow the project's existing code style and patterns

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create detailed changelog in /home/dappnode/barbossa-engineer/changelogs/
2. Focus on describing the USER VALUE of changes made
3. Include before/after descriptions for UI changes
4. Document any new features with usage examples
5. Report final status and suggest next feature opportunities
